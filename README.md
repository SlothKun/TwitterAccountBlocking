# TwitterAccountBlocking
Get a big list of user and block them right after

First, make sure you have all requirement package (see the import on top of each files)

Then, modify the Gettinguser.py with the right link and the right number of pages

Run the script, it'll give you a csv file that contains the name of all users in the blocklist

After that, modify Block_user.py and put your access token etc in the variable and run it
it'll block every user on the list (it'll take some times for big big lists /!\)
